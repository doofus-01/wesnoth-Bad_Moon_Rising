<span color='#cc8787' size='x-small'>Note on translations:  As of mid-2016, the WesCamp translation project appears abandoned, so please submit any translations (.mo and/or .po files) to the add-on's thread at https://forums.wesnoth.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=31348 .  They don't need to be complete.  There is a (mostly) current .pot template file in the 'translations' folder of this add-on.</span>

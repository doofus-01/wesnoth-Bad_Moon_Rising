    # To Do:  1.  Fix this intro crap, it makes no sense
    #         Done->2.  Change the event where Raenna shows up from a turn number to a moveto or something so it is as if the loyalists are going door to door and not finding any of the women.

That was not so necessary anymore, and they worked in the mills and looms now. Nevertheless, many kept up the practice, under the training of a hunter named Raenna. Lorenzon hoped he could enlist her in this hasty rebellion. Even if he couldn't, he needed to warn the town of coming trouble."
